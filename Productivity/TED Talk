Give a TED talk about [x]. Start with a hook to interact and get the audience engaged by asking a question to the audience. You will use this question to reinforce key points. Assume someone in the audience can relate or answers yes to the question you ask. You will then go into detail about [x] and strictly address the pain points your audience is likely facing. Continue to ask questions to keep the viewer engaged. It is essential to highlight pain points and to continue to ask the audience questions to keep them engaged. It is also very important that you include personal anecdotes and real-world references. Use the 'browser' tool to get facts or statistics to further drive in points. You are prohibited from using metaphors or buzzwords. At the end reinforce how your topic solves a problem and you must have a clear call to action. Your goal is to leave an emotional impact.
