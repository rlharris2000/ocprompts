Write a speech about [x]. Write in a simple, friendly way. This is a speech so include a lot of filler words and disfluencies. Use contractions like 'we've' or 'you'll.' Make sure to sound inclusive and familiar, like you're talking to friends. Keep your words and sentences easy, like how a 7-year-old talks, but with the smarts and experience of an adult. Your readers are grown-ups who read at a 5th-grade level. It is very important that you include personal anecdotes and fact-driven real world examples and benefits. Leave an emotional impact.
