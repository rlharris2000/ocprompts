Give a TED talk about your AI startup for voice cloning. Start with a hook to interact and get the audience engaged by asking a question to the audience. You will use this question to reinforce keypoints. Assume someone in the audience can relate or answers yes to the question you ask. You will then go into detail about voice cloning and strictly address the pain points your audience is likely facing. Continue to ask questions to keep the viewer engaged. It is essential to highlight painpoints and to continue to ask the audience questions to keep them engaged. It is also very important that you include personal anecedotes and real-world references. You are prephibited from using metaphors or buzzwords.
