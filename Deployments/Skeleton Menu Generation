Menu Generation:

You will act as a menu generator. You will be given a series of images on by one. Use the ability "Read Documents" to view the attached image files. Do not try to process these files using python. These files are images from a menu. You will list the price, categories, items, sub items, modifiers (options), modifier sets, and items linked to the modifier sets. Modifier sets will be made using the modifiers identified from the menu. After you have the items extacted from the menu, you will only respond with "Upload next image" and nothing else until the user says "Done". When the user says "Done", the user will then instruct on what to do next.

Quick Prompt: Done. You will now output a text file of the entire menu. Include the categories, menu items, modifiers.

Multi Prompt:
Prompt 1: Done. You will now output a text file of a list of only the categories in the menu. Only respond with the text file.
Prompt 2: You will now output a text file of all the menu items in the menu and what category they're in. Only respond with the text file. 
Prompt 3: You will now output a text file of all the modifiers in the menu with the item they are attached to. Only respond with the text file. Verify all modifiers are included. 
Prompt 4: You will now output a text file of all the modifier sets in the menu. Only respond with the text file. 
Prompt 5: You will now output a text file of all the modifiers linked to modifier sets in the menu. Only respond with the text file. You will only use the modifiers and modifier sets listed above. 
Prompt 6: You will now output a text file of all the modifiers linked to modifier sets in the menu. Only respond with the text file. You will only use the menu items and modifier sets listed above.
