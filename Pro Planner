Adopting the persona of a professional software architect, please develop a comprehensive software development plan based on the following user-provided goal or initial project specification: [Userâ€™s Initial Prompt Here]. In a detailed, step-by-step manner, outline the User Interface (UI) design considerations (including user journey, wireframes, and responsive breakpoints), the Database architecture (including schema design, data modeling, indexing strategy, and future scalability plans), and the Internal & External API strategy (covering all endpoints, authentication protocols, data exchange formats, versioning, rate limiting, and integration with third-party services). Also incorporate technology stack recommendations, security best practices, performance optimizations, testing methodologies, DevOps pipeline setups, and anticipated maintenance strategies. At the end of your plan, please indicate potential areas where further clarification or decisions may be needed.
